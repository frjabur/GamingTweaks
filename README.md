A collection of cool hidden and not so hidden tweaks <br/>
This is heavily inspired by *RevisionOS* discord and Calypto's Guide.<br/>

**Note:** Some minimal stuff is Administrator protected/Windows protected, like disabling Scheduler service for example, best and easy method to make everything work in tweaking in Safe Mode.

## Custom ISOs
This is such a important move, will make `50%` of work done. Choose your ISO wisely. Removing/stripping too much cause more issues and incompatibility and doesnt help with performance or speed, i blindly trust those ISO community creators because they have much experience.

**Note:** Installing them in MBR or GPT might give you different feels ingame. Experiment between those two options<br/>
DWM (Desktop Window Manager) is prooved to be bad in every scenario, you should remove it in any win version. <br/>
Windows 7 is by far the best for performance, but you can wisely pick, experiment and tweak newer versions as well.<br/>

## Windows Timers

Windows timers are a complex topic. There are different types and results may vary. <br/>
To undo a command in bcdedit, do bcdedit /deletevalue X (where X is useplatformclock, x2apicpolicy, etc.)

bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes (Windows 8+) <br/>
This command forces the kernel timer to constantly poll for interrupts instead of wait for them; dynamic tick was implemented as a power saving feature for laptops but hurts desktop performance

bcdedit /set useplatformtick yes (Windows 8+) <br/>
Forces the clock to be backed by a platform source, no synthetic timers are allowed <br/>
Potentially better performance, lowers timer resolution to .488 instead of .5ms

**Time Stamp Counter** (TSC) (default) (bcdedit /set useplatformclock false) <br/>

TSC is reliable and will give you the lowest latency and highest fps, but not sure if best mouse feeling<br/>

**ACPI Power Management Timer** (PMT) (bcdedit /set useplatformclock true + HPET BIOS OFF) <br/>

PMT is a highly stable high frequency clock, it doesn't sync, because it is not set to a fixed heartbeat. It is frequency based, which means that it will never delay another tick from happening. This can eliminate the chance of having stutters.

**High Precision Event Timer** (HPET) (bcdedit /set useplatformclock true + HPET BIOS ON) <br/>

HPET is highly stable high frequency clock, but it is programmed to be synced tightly, since it is set to tick every x amount of time, regardless of hardware configuration. HPET would be good if all cores ticked at the exact same speed and were naturally synced, but that is something that rarely ever happens which is why it is bad for so many people. HPET is a hardware based, synthetic timer, windows made it for debugging purposes and most of the time almost everytime it shouldnt be used.
High frequency clocks like HPET may potentially allow for smoother gameplay and better sync at the expense of latency. <br/>

Different Windows versions (7/8/8.1/10) all have different ways of using the TSC <br/>
Some motherboards have no option to disable HPET, if you are advanced there is custom bios.

**Install SetTimerResolutionService**

This service increases the resolution of the Windows kernel timer, which will significantly lower latency.<br/>
Drop this file in C:/ folder, the file must be there to service work <br/>
Open command promt and paste: <br/>

`cd C:/` <br/>
`SetTimerResolutionService -install` <br/>

[Download SetTimerResolutionService](files/SetTimerResolutionService.exe)

**You can optionally use my settings, but i would love you to understand and try out what i just writed.**

`bcdedit /set useplatformclock no` <br/>
`bcdedit /set useplatformtick yes` <br/>
`bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes` <br/>
`bcdedit /set nointegritychecks yes` <br/>
`bcdedit /set bootmenupolicy legacy` <br/>
`bcdedit /set bootux disabled` <br/>
`bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off` <br/>
`bcdedit /set nx optout` <br/>
`bcdedit /set quietboot yes` <br/>
`bcdedit /set tpmbootentropy default` <br/>
`bcdedit /set {globalsettings} custom:16000067 true` <br/>
`bcdedit /set {globalsettings} custom:16000068 true` <br/>
`bcdedit /set {globalsettings} custom:16000069 true` <br/>
`bcdedit /timeout 3` <br/>
`bcdedit /set uselegacyapicmode no` <br/>
`bcdedit /set usefirmwarepcisettings yes` <br/>
`bcdedit /set tscsyncpolicy legacy` <br/>
`bcdedit /set x2apicpolicy enable` <br/>
`add reg HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Reliability /v TimeStampInterval /t reg_dword /d 0 /f`

This is my current settings and with HPET BIOS OFF <br/>
If you see stutterings, you need to figure out better settings.

## MSI-Mode

MSI is Message Signaled-Based Interrupts, a faster and better method that replaces Windows Line-Based interrupt mode. <br/>
Some drivers default to using legacy pin-triggered interrupts, which are now emulated and are slower than using MSI.

**Only set sata if you have sure its compatible, if you set it wrong you will BSOD** <br/>

![MSI](/img/msi1.png)<br/>

Changing the values of PCI ISA Bridge and PCI CPU Host with the Interrupt Affinity Policy tool will make them appear in the list if you want. Simple set and unset affinities, most of the time messing with this should be minimal changes for best results.

[Download MSI-mode utility v2](http://www.mediafire.com/file/2kkkvko7e75opce/MSI_util_v2.zip/file) <br/>

## Affinity Policy Tool

This tool sets affinity for a driverâ€™s interrupts, <br/>
Using only one CPU affinity for usb and gpu can yield improvements in performance and responsiveness

**Mouse device and correspondent USB controler/hub to one single CPU (I use CPU1)** <br/>
**GPU and correspondent PCI to a different one single CPU (I use CPU3)**

##  Process Scheduling

What is Win32Priority:

is the amount of time the Windows process scheduler allocates to a program. Short quantum will improve responsiveness at the expense of more context switching, or switching between tasks, which is computationally expensive. Long quantum will improve performance of programs at the expense of lower responsiveness. Why would you want long quantum, then? Well, it minimizes context switching and will make the game run smoother, resulting in better consistency when aiming. However, short quantum could potentially decrease input lag which would improve consistency as well. The higher the boost, the better the FPS and smoothness will be, but you may experience degraded input response with high boost. Generally, long quantum results in better smoothness but slightly degraded mouse response, whereas the opposite is true for short quantum.

New info by Nimble:
Calypto's guide and this text created based on him is written based on mouse interrupts being a background process
Thus no foreground boost, but from what I gather its the other way around. That mouse or keyboard determines what is the foreground, and then boost value determines how much more priority that thread gets
Which if its a game that uses raw input, the game gets boosted shunning background processes, while polling through raw input with higher priority, thus taking further mouse input over other background processes
So the one for smoothness(as he writes), would also be the best for input, on the condition that program is in exclusive fullscreen and using rawinput (not direct input)

**42 Decimal** = Short, Fixed, High foreground boost. 2A Hex<br/>
**41 Decimal** = Short, Fixed, Medium foreground boost. 29 Hex<br/>
**40 Decimal** = Short, Fixed, No foreground boost. 28 Hex<br/>
**38 Decimal** = Short, Variable, High foreground boost. 26 Hex<br/>
**37 Decimal** = Short, Variable, Medium foreground boost. 25 Hex<br/>
**36 Decimal** = Short, Variable, No foreground boost. 24 Hex<br/>
**26 Decimal** = Long, Fixed, High foreground boost. 1A Hex<br/>
**25 Decimal** = Long, Fixed, Medium foreground boost. 19 Hex<br/>
**24 Decimal** = Long, Fixed, No foreground boost. 18 Hex<br/>
**22 Decimal** = Long, Variable, High foreground boost. 16 Hex<br/>
**21 Decimal** = Long, Variable, Medium foreground boost. 15 Hex<br/>
**20 Decimal** = Long, Variable, No foreground boost. 14 Hex<br/>

**Try to understand the values, try to test the values, choose your desired value.**<br/>
I will no more recommend a single value, i can barely feel difference, tests in latency barely prove anything.<br/>
But seems like those values are the ones people like more: 42, 37, 26, 22, 16 <br/>

**To set Win32PrioritySeparation to 22 Decimal (16 Hex), paste this to Command Promt:**

`reg add "hklm\system\controlset001\control\prioritycontrol" /v win32priorityseparation /t reg_dword /d 00000022 /f`
